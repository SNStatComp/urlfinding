# urlfinding
Generic software for finding websites of enterprises using a search engine and machine learning.

## Introduction
This repository contains the software that was used for research on finding enterprise websites.
For a detailed description of the methodology implemented we refer to the
discussion paper on this subject from Statistics Netherlands 
'Searching for business websites' by Arnout van Delden, Dick Windmeijer and Olav ten Bosch
(to appear January 2020 on the website of Statistics Netherlands).

In short the software operates as follows:
* training a model for finding websites using google search for predicting in the train and test phase
* applying the trained model to a dataset with unknown URLs using google search in the predict phase

This process model is shown in the figure below:
